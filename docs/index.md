# Overview {-}

This guide supports the Core Quantitative Methods Course offered by the Goldsmiths' Graduate School. It is a living document and currently not more than a rough draft, but will grow over time. It does not follow the order of sessions in the course, instead it is ordered in a way that might allow you to see connections and hopefully helps  to look things up more easily.
